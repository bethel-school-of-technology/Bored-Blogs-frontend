      <p class="text-center">
        Bored Blog is a site where you can glean more information about exciting
        bored games that you can play when you're bored! We feature games old
        and new, suitable to many age ranges and skill levels.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
        We have several contributors that share their interests in games of all
        sorts - family games, strategy games, card games, trivia games, games
        with mystery and games of challenge. Each week we post a "Game of the
        Week" which features a game that the contributors are currently learning
        or have found a great interest in either its history, uniqueness or
        actual game play.

          Also known as the Game of Twenty Squares, Ur is a two-player strategy
          race board game that was first played during the early 3rd millennium
          BC. Like modern backgammon, the game combines elements of both
          strategy and luck.

        Don't be bored ... play a board game!
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        Board games have been played, travelled and evolved in most cultures and
        societies throughout history. A board game need not necessarily contain
        a physical board. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many
        contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no
        element of skill.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
        Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board
        games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board
        games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters,
        winning position, or accrual of points.
